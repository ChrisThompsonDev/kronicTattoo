# Kronic Tattoo
This is a simple static page for a tattoo shop. Shows off some of the work they have done and also inlcudes a contact panel.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This started as a template from HTML5UP.net. I modified to fit the the requirements of the project.

## Optimizations

This page took a long time to load so I had to go through and crop/compress the images. This reduced the page's footprint significantly.
